CTF Name: Imaginary CTF
Problem Name: Short Story
Date: 7/31/21 
Problem Category: Forensics


When you first open the problem it gives you a .txt file to download where the flag is hidden.

Opening the file with notepad gets you a list of random words that seem to have nothing in common. However, given the problem is Forensics we're likely dealing with Stegonargraphy. The information then should be hidden in the words somehow.

Under further examination you can see that there is a relationship between the length of the words all of them being 1-16 letters in length. So by reading in the file and taking the lengths of the words and treating them as hex you can find the nessage.
